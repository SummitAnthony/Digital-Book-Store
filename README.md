# Django Digital Book Store Learning Journey

Welcome to my Django Digital Book Store project! This has been a practical journey where I've picked up various Django skills. Here's a rundown of what I've learned:

## Learning Outcomes

### 1. Views
I learned how to create views in Django, which are basically the functions handling what users see on different pages. Think of them as controllers in the MVC pattern.

### 2. URL Patterns
Understanding URL patterns helped me direct users to the right views. Whether it's in the app's `urls.py` or the project level, it's about guiding the traffic in your app.

### 3. Models
Models are like blueprints for your database. I got the hang of defining what kind of data my app stores and how it's structured. Migrations, in simple terms, are applying these changes to the database.

### 4. Admin Panel
The admin panel is a handy tool for managing your app's data. Creating a superuser gave me access to this panel, allowing me to add and edit data easily.

### 5. Templates
I figured out how to use HTML pages in my Django app. With templates, I could show dynamic data from the database on these pages, making my app more interactive.

### 6. Static Files
Adding some style to my site was exciting! I learned to use CSS by organizing static files in a folder. The `{% load static %}` tag helped integrate these files into my pages.

### 7. Authentication
Implementing user login, logout, and sign-up features was a big step in making my app secure and user-friendly. It's the basic stuff needed for user management.

### 8. Django Signals
Django signals allowed different parts of my app to talk to each other. They're like notifications â€“ one part of the app can react when something happens elsewhere.

### 9. Class Based Views (CBVs)
CBVs provide a structured way to organize views. I found them more reusable and cleaner compared to function-based views.
